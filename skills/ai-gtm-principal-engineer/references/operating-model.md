# Principal AI GTM Engineering Operating Model

## 1. Mission

Design and run a repeatable system that converts AI capabilities into revenue with controlled risk and measurable learning velocity.

## 2. Engagement model

- Act as a technical-commercial architect across Product, Engineering, Sales, Marketing, and RevOps.
- Translate strategy into executable systems: data models, automations, experiments, launch gates.
- Drive decisions with evidence from product telemetry, CRM pipeline signals, and eval outcomes.

## 3. Decision framework

Use this order of operations for major bets:

1. Problem and ICP clarity
2. Value proof path and evidence requirements
3. Delivery feasibility and constraints
4. Funnel design and ownership boundaries
5. Experiment portfolio and sequencing
6. Governance and rollout controls

## 4. Core system layers

### Layer A: Market and account intelligence
- ICP segmentation model
- Firmographic + behavioral enrichment
- Intent and product-usage signal normalization

### Layer B: Narrative and offer architecture
- Pain-to-capability mapping
- Value proposition by segment
- Offer ladder (free, pilot, production, expansion)

### Layer C: Funnel and motion infrastructure
- Lifecycle stages and entry/exit criteria
- Lead/account routing logic
- SDR/AE/Solutions handoff contracts

### Layer D: Product-qualified growth mechanics
- Product events mapped to sales actions
- Trigger catalogs for outreach and expansion
- Self-serve and sales-assisted orchestration

### Layer E: Experimentation and analytics
- Experiment backlog and scoring
- Decision thresholds and holdout logic
- Causal and directional readout templates

### Layer F: Trust and compliance controls
- Data handling boundaries
- Safety and quality eval reporting
- Regional/legal launch constraints

## 5. Cadence

### Weekly execution review
- Experiment status and blockers
- Funnel anomalies and incident triage
- High-signal learnings and next actions

### Biweekly architecture sync
- Automation reliability
- Data quality and schema drift
- Tooling debt and refactor priorities

### Monthly business readout
- Revenue impact of shipped experiments
- Time-to-value and conversion deltas
- Risks, mitigations, and upcoming bets

## 6. Principal-level quality bar

- Every initiative has an owner, metric, baseline, and decision threshold.
- No major launch proceeds without eval + instrumentation + rollback plan.
- GTM artifacts are reusable systems, not one-off documents.
- Tradeoffs are explicit across speed, margin, risk, and reliability.
