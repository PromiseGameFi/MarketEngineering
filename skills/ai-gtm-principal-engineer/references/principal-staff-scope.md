# Principal/Staff GTM Engineer Scope for AI Projects

## Staff GTM Engineer focus

- Own one GTM system domain end-to-end (for example: lifecycle routing, PQA triggers, or experimentation analytics).
- Ship reliable automations and data contracts.
- Convert qualitative GTM pain points into engineering tickets and measurable outcomes.
- Mentor other GTM/RevOps engineers on data quality and workflow design.

## Principal GTM Engineer focus

- Define the multi-domain GTM architecture for the company.
- Align product strategy and revenue strategy through a common operating model.
- Set technical standards for launch readiness, experimentation, and governance.
- Drive cross-org decisions where tradeoffs are unclear (speed vs reliability, expansion vs support burden, growth vs policy risk).

## Required implementation domains

1. Data model and instrumentation
2. Routing and workflow automation
3. Experiment platform and decision logic
4. Sales-assist product surfaces (demos, copilots, ROI tooling)
5. Policy and trust controls in GTM workflows

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- Counting campaign outputs instead of revenue-impact deltas.
- Launching AI features without eval and incident playbooks.
- Treating CRM fields as metrics without event-source validation.
- Splitting ownership so no one is accountable for end-to-end buyer outcomes.

## Principal-level artifacts

- GTM architecture blueprint (system boundaries + ownership)
- Quarterly bet portfolio with scoring and dependencies
- Launch gate policy with pass/fail criteria
- Executive scorecard linking product quality to commercial performance
